                        <h1>Hi! Let me tell you a little about myself..</h1>
                        <p>The last six months have been crazy. I have gone from working in Market Research in WInchester to travelling South East Asia for 2 months and now I am back home in England enjoying the lockdown.</p>
                        <p>I quit my job before I went travelling with a view of finding another job when I got back. Then Corona Virus hit.</p>
                        <p>With a lack of opportunity now, I decided that I wasn't going to let this get me down and I was going to focus on upskilling myself and having something to be proud of by the end of this virus.</p>
                        <p>I started learning Spanish, running 5k's, drawing and lastly, learning all about web development and cloud computing.</p>
                        <p>I am now very excited to say that I am an AWS certified Cloud Practioner and am now studying towards becoming a certified AWS Solutions Architect.</p>
