                <p>A motivated, logical and determined Forensic Science graduate looking for a role in Cloud Computing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have recently discovered a passion for Cloud Computing and have acquired AWS Solutions Architect (associate), AWS Developer (associate) and Cloud Practitioner certificate. I have acquired basic Python and SQL skills too to improve my skillset further. With a background in science I have developed good technical skills and an ability to pick up things quickly. Working for the last 2 and a half years in market research has given me great project management skills and improved my commercial understanding of how businesses operate. As an analytical thinker, I have a strong eye for detail and am quickly able to recognise trends, with drive and determination to succeed in everything I do. I am looking for a chance to succeed and will give my all to do well in a rewarding environment.</p>

                        <li>Built a serverless resume website using the AWS cloud infrastructure.</li>
                        <li>I host this website in Amazon S3 behind the content delivery network, CloudFront, and then I used Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for the backend.</li>
                        <li>I used AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to deploy a backend of API Gateway, DynamoDB and a Lambda function written in python.</li>
                        <li>My website uses continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices/tools in both the frontend and backend to make updates easier, quicker and automatic.</li>
                        <li>The backend was used for updating a visitor count on my webpage and so involved some javascript in my frontend.</li>
