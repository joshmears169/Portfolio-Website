                        <h1>Hi! Let me tell you a little about myself..</h1>
                        <p>Well, this year has been a crazy one. I have gone from working in Market Research in Winchester to travelling around South East Asia for 2 months and now I am back home in England enjoying the 'new normal'.</p>
                        <p>I quit my job before I went travelling with a view of finding another job when I got back. Then Corona Virus hit.</p>
                        <p>With a lack of opportunity, I decided that I wasn't going to let this get me down and I was going to focus on upskilling myself and having something to be proud of by the end of this virus.</p>
                        <p>I started learning Spanish, running 5k's, drawing and lastly, learning all about cloud computing (and a little web development!).</p>
                        <p>I am now very excited to say that I have three AWS certificates and have learnt the basics of python, sql and the command line. I am now creating projects to try to demonstrate my new skills, with a view of getting my first role in the cloud very soon.</p>
                        <p>This website is a product of my first project using the AWS Cloud. You can read all about the project and my experience <a href="https://dev.to/joshmears169/the-cloud-resume-challenge-discovering-the-power-of-aws-1n4f">here!</a></p>
